-  Hello, Iâ€™m @jovonmayer, AKA Johanna, Song, or Yver. (She/Her)
- I like cybersecurity most, but I'm still *very* much in the learning process. I also like analyzing data and software development, but I do game design on the side. 
- Outside of programming, I enjoy swimming, drawing, and reading. Time is measured in increments between pool time. 
- I really like participating in and starting projects, so I'm always down to collab. 
- You can reach me at jovonmayer@gmail.com and I'll respond as soon as I can.
